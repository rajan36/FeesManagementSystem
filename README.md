# FeesManagementSystem

This is a demo of a fee management system for the students of an institution. The implementation of the system is based on Dot Net framework. The system is based on a universal application [Windows Desktop and Mobile App] that the students can use to pay their fee. The system has a simple UX and will be fast enough to provide access to stored information and transaction history in reasonable amount of time and have separate operation modes for the administrative staff and students.

Requirements to run this application:
  * Windows 10
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
  * sqlite3 extension for Visual Studio
